# Grant Pipeline Dashboard CI/CD Architecture Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the complete CI/CD architecture for the Grant Pipeline Dashboard application, implementing automated deployment to a DigitalOcean droplet on every push to the main branch.

```

## Workflow Triggers
- **Primary Trigger**: Push to `main` branch
- **Manual Trigger**: Workflow dispatch for manual deployments
- **Scheduled Trigger**: Weekly security scans

## Build Process (Docker Image Creation)

### Docker Build Strategy
The application uses a multi-stage Docker build process to optimize image size and security:

1. **Build Stage**: 
   - Use `node:20-alpine` as base image
   - Install dependencies with `npm ci`
   - Build Next.js application with `npm run build`
   - Remove development dependencies

2. **Production Stage**:
   - Copy built application from build stage
   - Use minimal runtime environment
   - Expose port 3000
   - Start application with `npm start`

### Build Optimization
- Cache Docker layers for faster builds
- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- Multi-stage build to reduce final image size

## Security Scanning Steps

### Static Analysis
- **Dependency Scanning**: Check for vulnerable npm packages using npm audit
- **Code Scanning**: GitHub Advanced Security for code vulnerabilities
- **Secrets Scanning**: Automatic detection of hardcoded secrets

### Container Security
- **Image Scanning**: Trivy for container vulnerability scanning
- **Base Image Validation**: Verify official base images
- **Runtime Security**: Docker security best practices

## Testing Phases
*Note: As per user requirements, comprehensive testing is not currently implemented but the framework is in place for future expansion.*

### Current Testing Approach
- **Build Validation**: Ensure application builds successfully
- **Basic Health Check**: Verify application starts without errors
- **Docker Image Validation**: Confirm container runs properly

### Future Testing Expansion
- Unit tests with Jest
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests with Cypress
- Performance testing with Artillery

## Deployment Strategy to DigitalOcean Droplet

### Deployment Method
- **SSH Deployment**: Secure deployment via SSH to DigitalOcean droplet
- **Zero-Downtime Deployment**: Blue-green deployment strategy
- **Rolling Updates**: Gradual rollout to minimize service disruption

### Deployment Process
1. **Pre-deployment Checks**:
   - Verify SSH connectivity to droplet
   - Check available disk space
   - Validate deployment credentials

2. **Application Deployment**:
   - Pull latest Docker image
   - Stop current container
   - Start new container with updated image
   - Verify application health

3. **Post-deployment Validation**:
   - Health check endpoint verification
   - Basic functionality testing
   - Performance monitoring initialization

## Environment Management for Secrets

### Required Secrets
The following secrets need to be configured in GitHub repository settings:

| Secret Name | Description | Usage |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `DIGITALOCEAN_HOST` | Droplet IP address | SSH deployment target |
| `DIGITALOCEAN_USERNAME` | SSH username | Deployment authentication |
| `DIGITALOCEAN_SSH_KEY` | Private SSH key | Secure droplet access |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL | Application database connection |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anonymous key | Client-side API access |
| `DOCKER_REGISTRY_TOKEN` | Container registry token | Image push authentication |

### Secret Management Best Practices
- All secrets stored in GitHub Actions secrets
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Regular credential rotation
- Principle of least privilege for access tokens

## Rollback Procedures

### Automated Rollback
- **Trigger Condition**: Deployment failure or health check failure
- **Rollback Process**:
 1. Automatically detect deployment failure
  2. Revert to previous Docker image version
  3. Restore previous container configuration
  4. Verify rollback success

### Manual Rollback
- **GitHub Interface**: Use GitHub Actions UI to redeploy previous workflow runs
- **Command Line**: Manual Docker image rollback via SSH
- **Version Control**: Tag-based rollback to specific commits

### Rollback Validation
- Health check verification after rollback
- Functionality testing of rolled-back version
- Notification of rollback completion

## Monitoring and Notifications

### Deployment Notifications
- **Success Notifications**: Slack/Email notification on successful deployment
- **Failure Notifications**: Immediate alert on deployment failure with error details
- **Rollback Notifications**: Alert when automatic rollback is triggered

### Health Monitoring
- **Application Health**: Continuous monitoring of application endpoints
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, and disk usage tracking
- **Error Tracking**: Integration with error monitoring services

### Performance Monitoring
- **Response Time**: API response time tracking
- **Uptime Monitoring**: Application availability monitoring
- **User Experience**: Frontend performance metrics
